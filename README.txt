The pstool package
v0.5

A package like "pst-pdf" for processing PostScript graphics
within pdfLaTeX documets. The difference with this package
is that every graphic is processed separately, drastically
speeding up compilation time.

Running `latex` on pstool.tex will produce the files
  pstool.ins, pstool.sty, and README.txt,
and compile the PDF documentation.

Executing `tex pstool.ins` produces the files above
except pstool.ins.
