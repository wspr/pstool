The pstool package
v1.4

A package like "pst-pdf" for processing PostScript graphics
with psfrag labels within pdfLaTeX documents. The difference
with this package is that every graphic is compiled individually,
drastically speeding up compilation time when only a single
figure needs re-processing.

Running `latex` on pstool.tex will produce the files
  pstool.ins, pstool.sty, and README.txt,
and compile the PDF documentation.

Executing `latex pstool.ins` produces the files above
except pstool.ins (and the PDF file, obviously).

Please see the PDF documentation for further information.

Brief change history

v1.4, November 2010:  
  - More robust parsing of the main input file to read in the preamble.
    Therefore, \EndPreamble is now required much less often.

v1.3, July 2009: 
  - [bitmap] option to control compression of bitmap graphics,
  - Package options may now be set anywhere with \pstoolsetup{},
  - localised pstool options can be set per-graphic.

\section{Introduction}

While directly producing \PDF\ output with pdf\/\LaTeX\ is a great improvement in many ways over the `old method' of \DVI$\to$\PS$\to$\PDF, it loses the ability to interface with a generic PostScript workflow, used to great effect in numerous packages, most notably \pkg{PSTricks} and \pkg{psfrag}.

Until now, the best way to use these packages while running pdf\/\LaTeX\ has been to use the \pkg{pst-pdf} package, which processes the entire document through a filter, sending the relevant PostScript environments (only) through a single pass of \LaTeX\ producing \DVI$\to$\PS$\to$\PDF. The resulting \PDF\ versions of each graphic are then included into the pdf\/\LaTeX\ document in a subsequent compilation. The \pkg{auto-pst-pdf} package provides a wrapper to perform all of this automatically.

The disadvantage with this method is that for every document compilation, \emph{every} graphic must be re-processed. The \pkg{pstool} package uses a different approach to allow each graphic to be processed only as needed, speeding up and simplifying the typesetting of the main document.

At present this package is designed solely as a replacement for \pkg{pst-pdf} in the r\^ole of supporting the \pkg{psfrag} package (which it loads) in pdf\/\LaTeX. 

More flexible usage to provide a complete replacement for \pkg{pst-pdf} (e.g., supporting the \cs{begin\{postscript\}} environment) is planned for a later release. If you simply need to automatically convert plain \EPS\ files to \PDF, I recommend using the \pkg{epstopdf} package with the \pkgopt{update,prepend} package options (\pkg{epstopdf} and \pkg{pstool} should be completely compatible).

Processing pdf\/\LaTeX\ documents with \pkg{pstool} requires the `shell escape' feature of pdf\/\TeX\ to be activated.
This allows execution of auxiliary commands from within \LaTeX, a feature which is often disabled by default for security reasons.
If shell escape is not enabled, a warning will be issued in console output when the package is loaded.
Depending how you compile your \LaTeX\ document, shell escape is enabled in different ways.%
\footnote{On the command line, use the \texttt{-shell-escape} switch. Otherwise, you're on your own.}

Load the package as usual; no package options are required by default, but there are a few useful options described later in section~\ref{pkgopt}.
Note that you do not need to load \pkg{psfrag} separately.
You also do not need to load \pkg{graphicx} separately, but if you do so, ensure that you do \emph{not} include driver information (such as |[pdftex]|); this will play havoc with \pkg{pstool}'s automatic processing stage.

The generic command provided by this package is\par
{\centering
  \cmd\pstool\ \oarg{options} \marg{filename} \marg{input definitions}
\par}
It converts the graphic \meta{filename}|.eps| to \meta{filename}|.pdf| through a unique \DVI$\to$\PS$\to$\PDF\ process for each graphic, using the preamble of the main document.
The resulting graphic is then inserted into the document, with \meta{options} consisting of options for \pkg{graphicx} (e.g., \texttt{angle}, \texttt{scale}) or for \pkg{pstool} (as described later in Section~\ref{pkgopt}).
Note that these optional arguments take effect in the \emph{processing stage}; if you change the \meta{options}, you must manually re-process the figure.
The third argument to \cmd\pstool\ allows arbitrary \meta{input definitions} (such as \cmd\psfrag\ directives) to be inserted before the figure as it is processed. 

The command \cmd\pstool\ can take an optional |*| or |!| suffix to change the behaviour of the command:
\begin{description}
\item[\cs{pstool}] Process the graphic \meta{filename}|.eps| if \meta{filename}|.pdf| does not already exist, or if the \EPS\ file is \emph{newer} than the \PDF;
\item[\cs{pstool*}] Always process this figure; and,
\item[\cs{pstool!}] Never process this figure.
\end{description}
The behaviour in these three cases can be overridden globally by the package option \pkgopt{process} as described in section~\ref{process}.

It is useful to define higher-level commands based on \cmd\pstool\ for including specific types of \EPS\ graphics that take advantage of \pkg{psfrag}. As an example, this package defines the following command, which also supports the |*| or |!| suffixes described above.
\begin{description}
\item[{\cmd\psfragfig\oarg{opts}\marg{filename}}] 
This is the catch-all macro to support a wide range of graphics naming schemes. It inserts an \EPS\ file named either \meta{filename}|-psfrag.eps| or \meta{filename}|.eps| (in that order of preference), and uses \pkg{psfrag} definitions contained within either \meta{filename}|-psfrag.tex| or \meta{filename}|.tex|. 
\end{description}
This command can be used to insert figures produced by the \textsc{Mathematica} package \pkg{MathPSfrag} or the \textsc{Matlab} package \pkg{matlabfrag}. \cmd\psfragfig\ also accepts an optional braced argument:
\begin{description}
\item[{\cmd\psfragfig\oarg{opts}\marg{filename}\marg{input definitions}}] 
As above, but inserts the arbitrary code \meta{input definitions}, which will usually be used to define new or override existing \pkg{psfrag} commands.
\end{description}

\section{Package options}
\label{pkgopt}

Package options can be set or overridden at any time with \cmd\pstoolsetup\marg{pstool settings}.
As mentioned in the previous section, these options also may be set in the optional argument to \cmd\pstool\ and \cmd\psfragfig, in which case they apply to that figure alone.

\subsection{Forcing/disabling graphics processing}
\label{process}

While the suffixes |*| and |!| can be used to force or disable (respectively) the processing of each individual graphic, sometimes we want to do this on a global level. The following package options override \emph{all} \pkg{pstool}  macros: 
\begin{description}
\item[\pkgopt{process=auto}] This is the default mode as described in the previous section, in which graphics without suffixes are only (re-)processed if the \EPS\ file is newer or the \PDF\ file does not exist;
\item[\pkgopt{process=all}] Suffixes are ignored and all \cmd\pstool\ graphics are processed;
\item[\pkgopt{process=none}] Suffixes are ignored and no \cmd\pstool\ graphics are processed.\footnote{If \pkg{pstool} is loaded in a \LaTeX\ document in \DVI\ mode, this is the option that is used since no external processing is required for these graphics.}
\end{description}

\subsection{Cropping graphics}
The default option \pkgopt{crop=preview} selects the \pkg{preview} package to crop graphics to the appropriate size for each auxiliary process.

However, when an inserted label protrudes from the natural bounding box of the figure, or when the original bounding box of the figure is wrong, the \pkg{preview} package will not always produce a good result (with parts of the graphic trimmed off the edge). A robust method to solve this problem is to use the \pkg{pdfcrop} program instead.%
\footnote{\pkg{pdfcrop} requires a Perl installation under Windows, freely available from \url{http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/index.plex}} This can be activated in \pkg{pstool} with the \pkgopt{crop=pdfcrop} package option. 

\subsection{Temporary files \& cleanup}
Each figure that is processed spawns an auxiliary \LaTeX\ compilation through \DVI$\to$\PS$\to$\PDF. This process is named after the name of the figure with an appended string suffix; the default is \pkgopt{suffix=\{-pstool\}}. All of these suffixed files are ``temporary'' in that they may be deleted once they are no longer needed.

As an example, if the figure is called |ex.eps|, the files that are created are |ex-pstool.tex|, |ex-pstool.dvi|, \dots. The \pkgopt{cleanup} package option declares via a list of filename suffixes which temporary files are to be deleted after processing.

The default is \pkgopt{cleanup=\{.tex,\,.dvi,\,.ps,\,.pdf,\,.log,\,.aux\}}. To delete none of the temporary files, choose \pkgopt{cleanup=\{\}} (useful for debugging).

\subsection{Interaction mode of the auxiliary processes}
Each graphic echoes the output of its auxiliary process to the console window; unless you are trying to debug errors there is little interest in seeing this information. The behaviour of these auxiliary processes are governed globally by the \pkgopt{mode} package option, which takes the following parameters:
\begin{description}
\item[\pkgopt{mode=batch}] hide almost all of the \LaTeX\ output (\emph{default});
\item[\pkgopt{mode=nonstop}] echo all \LaTeX\ output but continues right past any errors; and 
\item[\pkgopt{mode=errorstop}] prompt for user input when errors in the source are encountered.
\end{description}
These three package options correspond to the \LaTeX\ command line options \texttt{-interaction=batchmode}, \texttt{=nonstopmode}, and \texttt{=errorstopmode}, respectively. When \pkgopt{mode=batch} is activated, then \pkg{dvips} is also run in `quiet mode'.

\subsection{Auxiliary processing command line options}
The command line options passed to each program of the auxiliary processing can be changed with the following package options:
\begin{description}
\item[\pkgopt{latex-options=...}]
\item[\pkgopt{dvips-options=...}]
\item[\pkgopt{ps2pdf-options=...}] and,
\item[\pkgopt{pdfcrop-options=...}] (if applicable).
\end{description}
For the most part these will be unnecessary, although passing the correct options to |ps2pdf| can sometimes be a little obscure.\footnote{The manual is here: \url{http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/cvs/Ps2pdf.htm}} For example, I use the following for generating figures in my thesis:%
\footnote{Note that each \texttt{ps2pdf} option must be quoted in Windows, which is unnecessary but does no harm in Linux and Mac~OS~X.}%
\par{\centering|ps2pdf-options={"-dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress"}|\par}
This forces the `base fourteen' fonts to be embedded within the individual figure files, without which some printers and \textsc{pdf} viewers have trouble with the textual labels. In fact, from v1.3 of \pkg{pstool}, this option is now the default.
Note that subsequent calls to \pkgopt{ps2pdf-options=...} will override the \pkg{pstool} default; use |ps2pdf-options={}| to chose |ps2pdf|'s defaults if necessary. 

\subsection{Compression of bitmap data}
In the conversion using |ps2pdf|, bitmap images are stored using either lossy or lossless compression. The default behaviour for \pkg{pstool} is to force lossless compression, because we believe that to be the most commonly desired use case (you don't want scientific graphics rendered with possible compression artifacts). This behaviour can be adjusted using one of these options:\footnote{Technical details are given in section~\ref{sec:bitmapdetails}.}
\begin{description}
\item[\pkgopt{bitmap=auto}] do whatever |ps2pdf| does by default, which seems to be to use lossy compression most, if not all, of the time;
\item[\pkgopt{bitmap=lossy}] bitmap images are compressed like \textsc{jpg}; this is only really suitable for photographs;
\item[\pkgopt{bitmap=lossless}] bitmap images are compressed like \textsc{png}; this is suitable for screenshots and generated data such as a surface plot within Matlab (\emph{default}).
\end{description}
These are just special cases of the \pkgopt{ps2pdf-options=...} option, but using \pkgopt{bitmap=...} is much more convenient since the |ps2pdf| options to effect this behaviour are quite verbose.
Note that the |auto| and |lossy| outputs differ in quality; |lossy| is lower quality than |auto| even when the latter uses a lossy compression scheme. Adjusting the quality for these options is only possible with relatively complex Ghostscript options.

\section{Miscellaneous details}

\subsection{The \cmd\EndPreamble\ command}

At present, \pkg{pstool} scans the preamble of the main document by redefining |\begin{document}|, but this is rather fragile  because many classes and packages do their own redefining which overwrites \pkg{pstool}'s attempt. In this case, place the command \cmd\EndPreamble\ where-ever you'd like the preamble in the auxiliary processing to end (although is must be placed before |\begin{document}| for obvious reasons). This is also handy to bypass anything in the preamble that will never be required for the figures but which will slow down or otherwise conflict with the auxiliary processing.

\subsection{Cross-reference limitations}

The initial release of this package does not support cross-references within the \pkg{psfrag} labels of the included graphics. (If, say, you wish to refer to an equation number or a citation within a figure.)

\subsection{A note on file paths}

\pkg{pstool} tries to ensure that you can put image files in subdirectories of the main document and the auxiliary processing will still function correctly. In order to ensure this,  the external |pdflatex| compilation uses the |-output-directory| feature of pdf\/\TeX. This command line option is definitely supported on all platforms from TeX~Live~2008 and MiKTeX~2.7 onwards, but earlier distributions may not be supported.

One problem that \pkg{pstool} does not solve on its own is the inclusion of images that do not exist in subdirectories of the main document. For example, |\pstool{../Figures/myfig}| can not process by default because pdf\/\TeX\ usually does not have permission to write into folders that are higher in the heirarchy than the main document. This can be worked around presently in two different ways: (although maybe only for Mac~OS~X and Linux)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Give |pdflatex| permission to write anywhere with the command:\\
|openout_any=a pdflatex ...|
\item Create a symbolic link in the working directory to a point higher in the path: |ln -s ../../PhD ./PhD|, for example, and then refer to the graphics through this symbolic link.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Technical details on \texttt{ps2pdf}'s bitmap options}
\label{sec:bitmapdetails}

The \pkgopt{bitmap=auto} \pkg{pstool} option does not set any |ps2pdf| options; use this if you wish to set the following |ps2pdf| options manually.

For both \pkgopt{bitmap=lossless} (default) and \pkgopt{bitmap=lossy}, the following |ps2pdf| options are set:
\begin{verbatim}
    -dAutoFilterColorImages=false
    -dAutoFilterGrayImages=false
\end{verbatim}
Then for lossless image encoding, the following options are set:
\begin{verbatim}
    -dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode
    -dGrayImageFilter=/FlateEncode
\end{verbatim}
Instead for lossly encoding, these are the options used:
\begin{verbatim}
    -dColorImageFilter=/DCTEncode
    -dGrayImageFilter=/DCTEncode
\end{verbatim}
If there are more |ps2pdf| options that you frequently use, please let me know and it may be a good idea to add \pkg{pstool} wrappers to make them more convenient.
